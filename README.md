# RecordAnalyzer
Web app for basic signal processing

Description

The RECANA (Record Analyzer) web application offers a comprehensive solution for the processing and analysis of acceleration data in earthquake engineering. It supports a wide range of data formats, including MiniSEED, SAC, ASC, and GCF, allowing for easy import of strong-motion data. RECANA features a variety of essential tools, including data trimming, baseline correction, and filtering options (high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass). Users can export processed data to flat file formats (TXT, CSV, XLSX) and calculate critical metrics such as velocity and displacement time series, peak values, Arias Intensity, Significant Duration, and Cumulative Absolute Velocity. Additionally, it performs spectral analysis with Fourier Transform, Power Spectral Density, and Spectrogram, and generates Response Spectrum and Design Spectrum in accordance with the TBEC 2018 Turkish Building and Earthquake Code. By providing these capabilities, RECANA enhances the analytical tools available to engineers and seismologists, facilitating effective assessment of ground motion or structural vibration data.
